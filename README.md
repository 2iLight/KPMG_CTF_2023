# KPMG 2023 CTF Write-up

This repository contains a curated set of write-ups for the CTF challenges, organized by category, providing detailed analysis and solutions for participants seeking guidance or comparing approaches. However, it is essential to note that this repository exclusively showcases challenges that I have personally solved and may not encompass all the challenges that were present in the CTF.

## Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineering is the art of deconstructing and analyzing a given piece of software, with the aim of understanding its inner workings, algorithms, and functionalities.
<!-- The Reverse Engineering CTF challenges participants to decipher and dissect complex binary executables, applying their expertise in reverse engineering to unveil concealed secrets and extract hidden flags. -->

## Cryptography

Cryptography is the the art of securing information by converting it into a code that can only be read by the intended recipient. In a cryptography CTF the goal is the decipher the text and obtain the flag.

1. [CryptoShift](/resources/CryptoShift.md)
2. [XOR Solitary Cipher](/resources/XOR%20Solitary%20Cipher.md)

## OSINT

OSINT is the art of gathering and analyzing information from publicly available sources to produce actionable intelligence. It is a critical component of cybersecurity research, threat modeling, and social engineering.
